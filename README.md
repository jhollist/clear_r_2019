# A primer for R with ESRI.

This repository contains materials for a workshop for UConn CLEAR.  The workshop 
will provide attendees with an primer on the R Language for statistical 
computing and how R can be used to work with spatial data natively and via 
ESRI's R-ArcGIS Bridge.  We will cover:

- R Syntax
- Packages
- Data Types and Data Structures
- Reading in external data
- Basic Data Manipulation
- Installing and using the R-ArcGIS Bridge

This workshop will be held on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 at the University of Rhode
